# laravel-eloquent-snippets package

Snippets for Atom to generate Eloquent code ~~based~~ ripped off on [Adam Wathan's snippets for Sublime Text](https://gist.github.com/adamwathan/723a3ad31e1586b66450).

## Example

Typing `belm` would generate a `$this->belongsToMany()` function. `belo` for belongs-to-one, `hasm` for has many and `haso` for has one. Pretty straightforward.
